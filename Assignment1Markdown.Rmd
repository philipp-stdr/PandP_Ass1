```{r}
# Set working directory (for Unger's computer - dual work-path produces an error)
setwd("/Users/Unger/Documents/Collaborative Social Science/Collaborative Analysis Assignments/PandP_Ass1")

# Load packages and create BibTeX file (just examples)
PackagesUsed <- c("ggplot2", "repmis", "rio")

# Load PackagesUsed and create .bib BibTeX file
repmis::LoadandCite(PackagesUsed, file = "Ass1Packages.bib", install = FALSE)
```

## This is a demo if we want to base assignment 1 on a markdown file

### Dual-work directory file - I can't make it work as of now
possiblewd <- c("~/Dropbox/4_Spring_2016/2_Collaborative Data Analysis/", 
                "~/Documents/Collaborative Social Science/Collaborative Analysis Assignments/PandP_Ass1")
set_valid_wd(possiblewd)
